   /*Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
    1. Compile time polymorphism
    Compile time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        1.1 Function overloading
        1.2 Operator Overloading
    2. Run time polymorphism
    Run time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        2.1 Virtual functions*/
